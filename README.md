This respository contains NMAlgorithm.py which employs the Nelder-Mead minimisation method to extract the material parameters of samples from THz-TDS data in transmission mode. It relies on spectra.py which acts as a utilities file and uses some features from lyterProcessing3.py.

There is also a user GUI under development, but not yet completed/fully functional.
